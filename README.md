## Background & Mission

As an avid reader with a visual memory, I often struggle with the generic and sometimes cluttered web interfaces of audiobook sites. I built the initial version of this site in a moment of desperation, when I was trying to listen to an audiobook of _The Count of Monte Cristo_ and found myself wishing there was a way to listen that would look and feel less like a generic website and more like a physical edition of the book.

Once the first version was built, I realized that this could be a great site to expand and make public for three reasons:

1. To make the audiobook experience more pleasant
2. To highlight the amazing [Librivox catalog](https://librivox.org/) of public domain audiobooks
3. To promote and make more accessible the reading of classic literature

## Features

- **Customized cover images:** Classical paintings selected to represent book content; if no cover image selected, will implement randomized selection from a set of paintings
- **Minimal mode**: Option to hide all unnecessary buttons and info and focus on the reading experience

All audiobooks sourced from the [Librivox](https://librivox.org/) library of free public domain audiobooks, hosted via [Archive.org](https://archive.org/)

## Next Steps

- [x] Build starter homepage to navigate between current titles
- [ ] Switch to [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/) to retrieve cover images
- [ ] Build new cover image data structure & associated functions
- [ ] Search functionality using the [Librivox API](https://librivox.org/api/info)
- [ ] Migrate styling from CSS -> SASS
- [ ] Begin building animations with GSAP

## Long-term Goals

- [ ] Use Librivox RSS feed to rebuild player from scratch
- [ ] Create bookmark functionality using `localStorage` to save user's place
- [ ] Create "back of book" view to display more detailed book info (and cover credits) without interrupting audio play
- [ ] Enable user-submitted cover suggestions
- [ ] Transfer site from GitHub pages to Vercel or AWS, with a separate custom domain
- [ ] Work with a team to create a backend to allow for account login and features like saving progress, creating TBR and favorites lists, and accessing reading history
