All audiobooks sourced from the [Librivox](https://librivox.org/) library free public domain audiobooks, hosted via [Archive.org](https://archive.org/)


## Technologies Used
- [React](https://react.dev/) built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Next Steps
- Build homepage and search functionality using the [Librivox API](https://librivox.org/api/info)
- Create simple data storage system to link API data to cover image link and sizing info
- Create "back of book" view to display more detailed book info without interrupting audio play

## Long-term Goals
- Transfer site from GitHub pages to Vercel or AWS, with a separate custom domain
- Use [Archive.org API](https://archive.org/developers/index.html) to rebuild player from scratch and implement further visual customization
- Work with a team to create a backend to allow for account login and features like saving progress, creating TBR and favorites lists, and accessing reading history
